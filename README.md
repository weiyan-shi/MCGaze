## 🥰Our work has been accepted by IEEE Signal Processing Letters！

## ✨Demo code has been added to this repo！
Inspired by [gaze360-demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SJbzd-gFTbiYjfZynIfrG044fWi6svbV?usp=sharing) and [yolov5-crowdhuman](https://github.com/deepakcrk/yolov5-crowdhuman). We use gaze estimation for each person in a video and visualize it. You can see `MCGaze_demo` for more details.

## Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "End-to-end Video Gaze Estimation via Capturing Head-face-eye Spatial-temporal Interaction Context".

</div>

We propose to facilitate video gaze estimation via capturing spatial-temporal interaction context among head, face, and eye in an end-to-end learning way, which has not been well concerned yet. Experiments on the challenging Gaze360 dataset verify the superiority of our proposition.
## Results and models
In our work, we test our model in two different dataset settings (Gaze360-setting and [l2CS-setting](https://github.com/Ahmednull/L2CS-Net)(i.e., only consider face detectable samples)) for fair comparison with the previous methods.

You can download the checkpoint for the model from the link inside the table.

## Get Started
### Prepare your python environment
1. Create a new conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n MCGaze python=3.9
   conda activate MCGaze
   ```
   
2. Install Pytorch (1.7.1 is recommended).
   ```bash
   pip install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   ```

4. Install MMDetection. 

   * Install [MMCV-full](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html) first. 1.4.8 is recommended.
     ```bash
     pip install mmcv-full==1.4.8 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu110/torch1.7.1/index.html
     ```

   * ```bash
     cd MCGaze
     pip install -v -e .
     ```

   If you encounter difficulties during use, please open a new issue or contact us.
### Prepare your dataset
1. Download Gaze360 dataset from [official](http://gaze360.csail.mit.edu/).
2. Download the train.txt and test.txt in [Gaze360's official GitHub repo](https://github.com/erkil1452/gaze360/tree/master/code).
3. Using our code to reorganize the file structure. You should modify the paths first.
   * ```bash
     python tools/gaze360_img_reorganize.py
     ```

4. Download the COCO format annotation from this [annotations](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tNvXMn52bth8zSCGZK_syP6gdt7VLjGq?usp=drive_link), and put them into corresponding folders.

Here is the right hierarchy of folder `MCGaze/data` below:

### Inference & Evaluation

* Run the commands below for inference and evaluation in different settings. 

If you want to evaluate the model without training by yourself, you need to download our [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OX_nuxXYTH5i8E11UCyEcAsp6ExHDMra?usp=sharing) (we recommend that you can create a new folder "ckpts" and put the files in it). 

And remember to check if the file paths of shells are right.

##### Gaze360-setting

  ```bash
  bash tools/test_gaze360.sh
  ```

##### l2cs-setting

  ```bash
  bash tools/test_l2cs.sh
  ```


### Training

* Run the commands below to begin training in different settings.
##### Gaze360-setting

  ```bash
  bash tools/train_gaze360.sh
  ```

##### l2cs-setting

  ```bash
  bash tools/train_l2cs.sh
  ```
